#YOUR SUBMISSION WILL BE A ZIP FILE WITH YOUR CODE (THIS FILE) AND YOUR PLOTS

#STEP 0: Import the Modules You Will Need
#(numpy, Table from astropy.table, and matplotlib.pyplot)

#STEP 1: Read the planetdiscoveries.csv file
#(Use the Table.read function from astropy.)

#STEP 2: Find the average orbital period of the listed planets.
#(This number should just be the arithmetic mean)
#(You can preview the csv file using Excel to learn what the column names mean!)
#Your UNITS should be in DAYS.
#YOUR CODE HERE

"""
The average orbital period of the listed planets is <your number here>.
"""

#STEP 3: Find the average ratio of planet radius to stellar radius; e.g. what is the average value of
#(planet radius / stellar radius)?
#(This number should just be the arithmetic mean)
#(Make sure your units are consistent! You can preview the csv file using Excel to learn what the units are!)
#YOUR CODE HERE
